# Boost 
#  you can give hints to find_package in order to find your favorite boost build
#  if you use the boost coming with XPIR helper_script.sh, set BOOST_ROOT to ./local as in the following line 
set(BOOST_ROOT "./local")
#  otherwise set it to your own boost build, by uncomenting the following one for example
#  but the order in which cmake.find_package searches potential directories is obscure and 
#  we recommend you double-check the output of cmake to see if it picked the proper build
# set(BOOST_ROOT "/usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.60.0_2/")

# OSX users : there is an issue between clang-compiled libraries and gcc-compiled binaries (and vice-versa)
#   since XPIR is compiled with gcc, it must be linked with gcc-compiled boost libraries
#   or you'll get link-errors.
#   if you use XPIR helper-script to install the dependencies, nothin to worry about, they'll be gcc'ed
#   if you use macport, you can enforce compilation with gcc by using commands like
#      $port upgrade --force boost configure.compiler=macports-gcc-4.9 (or gcc-4.9 for example)
#   if you use brew, you need to modify your formula in order to compile with gcc
#      by following these advices : https://solarianprogrammer.com/2016/03/06/compiling-boost-gcc-5-clang-mac-os-x/

# Some users also reported that linking against static boost libraries solves the problem.
